1. hopping sequence
- Should scan 2 channels on M-band and 1 on O-band
- time slots: 1 sec or 0.4 sec ?
- 15 sec timebase, same as timestamp cycle


2. new packet type of the same size
- shorten coordinates: 2x16 bits instead of 2x24bits
  - longitude shortened depending on latitude
- this will save 2 bytes which can be used for turning rate
  and flags:
  - GPS jammed/spoofed
  - altitude is pressure not HAE
  - speed is air-speed not GPS (there are few types of air-speed)
  - heading is magnetic not GPS
  - turning rate is gyroscope not GPS
- replace accuracy 2 bytes with pressure altitude (14 bits)
  amd to flags:
  - pressure transducer has a proper static sensor

Motivations:
- provide pressure altitude which some systems use for anti-collision
- provide a set of data which can be sent when the GPS fails (jamming/spoofing)
  and then the aircraft can be MLAT and still transmit valid pressure altitude for deconflicting
